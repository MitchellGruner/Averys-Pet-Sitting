I make it a point to connect with each furry friend on a playful level, whether it's through feather toys, gentle belly rubs, or simply chatting with them in their own language of purrs and meows. My knack for understanding their individual quirks means I can create a comfortable and enjoyable experience tailored to their preferences. Being a cat sitter isn't just a job for meâ€”it's a passion rooted in making sure every kitty feels cherished and content under my watch."
