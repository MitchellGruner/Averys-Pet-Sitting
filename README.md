## Avery's Pet Sitting

This is a website I built for my girlfriend for her dog and cat sitting side-hustle. This application utilizes the T3 Stack (Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS), as well as Bootstrap and Sass for styling. This project utilizes a contact form so end-users can easily reach Avery via her email, as well as access her Calendly account to set up initial appointments. This website was built using mobile-first design, and will feature a back-end system in the near future.

## How It's Made

### Tech used: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Sass, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery

## Lessons Learned:

This project definitely tested my creative UI/UX design skills, and I am incredibly thankful that I had the opportunity to showcase my skills through this project. Creating a dynamic navbar that changes based on what page the user is currently on, creating a fixed background image that changed to absolute when a user scrolled past a certain point, and creating a seamless slideshow, definitely put my skills to the test. This project is ongoing, and I am hopeful to add a back-end system to the front-end as soon as possible.
